# 60 Days Of Solana
Solana Course
MODULE 1Introductory Topics
Day 1Hello World (and troubleshooting Solana installation)
Day 2Function arguments, math, and arithmetic overflow
Day 3Anchor function magic and the Interface Definition Language
Day 4Solana reverts, errors, and basic access control
Day 5Where is the constructor? About anchor deploy
MODULE 2The minimum Rust you need to know
Day 8-10 are not critical, they only explain some syntax which is likely unfamiliar to most readers. However, you can write Solana programs and follow along while treating the unusual syntax as boilerplate. Feel free to skim over those days.

Day 6Solidity Translations to Rust and Solana
Day 7The unusual syntax of Rust
Day 8Understanding function-like macros in Rust
Day 9Rust Structs and Attribute-like and Custom Derive Macros
Day 10Translating Solidity function visibility and contract inheritance to Solana
MODULE 3Important System-level Information in Solana
Day 11Block variables in Solana: block.timestamp and block.number and others
Day 12Beyond the block: sysvars
Day 13Solana logs, events, and transaction history
Day 14tx.origin, msg.sender, and onlyOwner in Solana
Day 15Transaction fees and compute units
MODULE 4Accounts and Storage in Solana
Accounts are one of the most complicated topics in Solana development because they are considerably more flexible than Ethereum storage variables., so we go over them slowly. Each tutorial will progressively reinforce concepts, so don’t worry if all the new information doesn’t stick right away.

Day 16Accounts in Solana
Day 17Writing to storage
Day 18Reading Accounts from Typescript — an alternative to public variables and view functions
Day 19Creating mappings and nested mappings in Solana
Day 20Cost of storage, maximum storage size, and account resizing
Day 21Reading an account balance in Rust: address(account).balance in Solana
Day 22More differences: modifiers, view pure, payable, and fallback in Solana
Day 23Building a payment splitter: “payable” and “msg.value” in Solana
Day 24Authorizing various wallets to write to an account: "Pranking tx.origin"
Day 25PDA vs Keypair Accounts
Day 26Understanding Account Ownership in Solana: Transferring SOL out of a PDA
Day 27init_if_needed and the Reinitialization Attack
Day 28Multicall in Solana: Batching Transactions
Day 29Owner vs Authority
Day 30Deleting Accounts and Closing Programs
Day 31Account types in #[derive(Accounts)]
Day 32Reading Another Anchor Program’s Account Data On Chain
Day 33Cross Program Invocation
